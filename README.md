CMSC 22 - Laboratory
Employing object-oriented design and OOP principles in solving the problem:

In a grocery store, the types of items sold are potion, food, armor, and weapon. Each item has
product ID, name, quantity in stock, and unit price. The store labels each potion with its
volume, key ingredients, and potion effect. For food items, the expiry date is monitored.
Armor items, on the other hand, are sold in different sizes, colors, and shield levels. For
weapon items, there are different types and capabilities. Aside from those, the damage level of
the weapon is also known.
Write a program that has two panels: Admin and Customer. In the Admin panel, the products
for sale can be added and removed. In the Customer panel, the customer can choose products
to buy through the product ID, and he/she can view product details. The chosen products are
placed in a cart, wherein the customer can add and remove products before check out. The
customers cannot choose products that are out of stock. Upon check out, the receipt should be
displayed such that it contains info about the total sale together with the details of the
products bought by the customer.
